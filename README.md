This little project is all about learning â€“ you know, inspired by that cool idea of using tests to master Golang. It's like taking theory and diving into the deep end of the coding pool, writing up some real code and giving it a whirl through testing. Think of it as a hands-on, learn-by-doing approach, all sparked by that nifty concept of a testing-driven Go learning website. ðŸ˜‰
